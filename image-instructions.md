# Adding Your Band Logo Image to the Website

To add the band logo image to your website, follow these steps:

1. Save the image you provided as `band-logo.jpg` in the `images` folder of your project.

2. Make sure the image is in JPG format. If it's in a different format (like PNG), you can convert it using an image editor or online converter.

3. The image should be high quality but optimized for web (ideally under 500KB in size).

4. If you need to resize the image, aim for a width of around 1200px for best results on larger screens.

## Alternative Method

If you prefer, you can also modify the HTML to use a different filename or format:

1. Open `index.html`
2. Find this line:
   ```html
   <img src="images/band-logo.jpg" alt="The Calm Blue Sea" class="responsive-img">
   ```
3. Change `band-logo.jpg` to your preferred filename (e.g., `band-logo.png`)

## Testing Your Website

After adding the image:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see your website
2. Check that the image displays correctly
3. Test the responsive design by resizing your browser window
4. Verify that the fade-in animations work as expected
